# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to visualise the ride sharing data in a line graph to show the weekly fares by city type.

## Results

### Data Table

To summarize the results above, the higher the population the higher the ride count, the more drivers there are, and thus the higher total fares recieved.  However, looking at the earning potential per ride and per driver - it is much higher in the rural settings.  This may be attributed to longer rides to get into the city. Also, having more drivers than rides in the Urban setting is not beneficial to the bottom line or earnings per driver.
 
### Weekly Trend

When looking at the chart above, there is no major fluctuation among the different types of rides - Urban is always earning the most fares and Rural the least.  There is a bit of increase overall toward the middle to end of February that may be attributed to Valentines day travels.  


## Summary

Based on all the data analyzed, I would recommend the following:
1. Obtain data to show on average how long customers are waiting to be picked up and compare that to how long drivers are waiting for a new route.  
2. Assuming the wait times are near zero in the Urban setting - one option would be to shift drivers from Urban to Rural routes.  This would likely decrease customer satifaction, however it would likely bring the average fare per driver closer together.
3. Another option would be to cut back on drivers in the Urban setting overall given that there are more drivers than rides.  This would also help increase the fare per driver.
